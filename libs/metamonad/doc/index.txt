mpllibs::metamonad
==================
Abel Sinkovics

The main purpose of this library is implementing monads and exception handling
for C++ template metaprograms. Apart from that it contains tools implementing
let expressions and lambda expressions for template metaprograms.
The library contains the following components:

* Let expressions
* Lambda expressions
* Haskell typeclasses in template metaprograms
* Monads for template metaprograms
* The do notation
* Compile-time exceptions

The library provides metafunctions for the monadic operations, that can be
overridden.
The library implements an embedded domain specific language based on
Haskell's do notation for monads. Template metaprograms using it are easier to
read and to maintain. Even though the library was built based on Haskell,
developers can use it without knowing the Haskell language.

The library implements an error handling mechanism for template metaprograms
that is similar to exception handling in runtime code. The library calls this
technique compile-time exception handling, and it is based on monads.

Introduction
------------

This library is built on top of boost::mpl, thus the reader is expected to be
familiar with that library and its concepts.
This tutorial introduces the different components of metamonad using examples.
Since the tools of the library extend each other, it is recommended to read this
tutorial in order.

Tags
----

The concept of +tags+ needs to be introduced first. This comes from boost::mpl,
metamonad is heavily dependent on it.

In boost::mpl every compile-time value has a member type called +tag+ that
is used to determine whether that value is a wrapped integral, a list, a vector,
etc. There may be more than one implementations of a compile-time data-type,
such as wrapped integrals. As long as they provide the same interface and have
the same +tag+, all metafunctions operating on the wrapped integrals can
deal with them. The +tag+ is used to identify that they are wrapped
integrals.

This +tag+ works like the type information of compile-time data-structures. 
Polymorphic metafunctions in boost::mpl get the +tag+ information of the
arguments, instantiate a helper metafunction class with the tags as template
parameters and pass the original arguments to that metafunction class. Different
specializations of the metafunction class can be created for different tags and
tag combinations. Each specialization implements one overload of the
metafunction. Since a new specialization can be implemented without changing
existing code, new overloads for newly created classes can be implemented later.

Let expressions
---------------

metamonad implements let expressions in C++ template metaprogramming. A let
expression binds an expression to a name in the scope of another expression.
An expression is represented by a nullary metafunction, a name is represented
by a class. metamonad provides a metafunction, +let+, that takes the three
arguments mentioned above:

--------------------------------------
template <
  class Name,
  class ExpressionToBind,
  class ExpressionToBindInTheScopeOf
>
struct let;
--------------------------------------

It returns a nullary metafunction, which is an updated version of
+ExpressionToBindInTheScopeOf+: every occurrence of +Name+ is replaced with
+ExpressionToBind+ in the body of +ExpressionToBindInTheScopeOf+. An example:

--------------------------------------
struct x;

template <class N>
struct my_metafunction :
  let<
    x, boost::mpl::plus<N, boost::mpl::int_<13> >,
    boost::mpl::times<N, N>
  >::type
{};
--------------------------------------

Using +let+, many empty placeholder classes need to be created. Note that any
class can (+int+, template instances, etc.) be used as placeholder.

Lambda expressions
------------------

metamonad provides a lambda expression implementation for template metaprograms.
A lambda expression is a metafunction class taking (in the current
implementation exactly) one argument. Lambda expressions can be defined inside
the body of expressions. metamonad provides the +lambda+ metafunction class for
defining lambda expressions:

--------------------------------------
template <class Name, class Body>
struct lambda;
--------------------------------------

+Name+ is a placeholder for the argument that is passed to the lambda expression
when it is used as a metafunction class. +Body+ is a nullary metafunction,
which is the body of the lambda expression. When the lambda expression is called
with an argument, every occurrence of +Name+ is replaced with the value of the
argument in the body of +Body+, and the resulting nullary metafunction gets
evaluated.

Recursive let bindings
----------------------

The binding using +let+ happens non-recursively, thus it can not be used to
bind a recursive function (calling itself) to a name. For example, it can not be
used to implement a recursive factorial:

--------------------------------------
let<
  fact,
  lambda<
    n,
    boost::mpl::eval_if<
      boost::mpl::equal_to<n, boost::mpl::int_<0> >,
      boost::mpl::int_<1>,
      boost::mpl::times<
        boost::mpl::apply<
          fact,
          boost::mpl::minus<n, boost::mpl::int_<1> >
        >,
        n
      >
    >
  >,
  boost::mpl::apply<fact, boost::mpl::int_<3> >
>
--------------------------------------

In the above example the placeholder +fact+ in the body of the lambda expression
is not bound to itself, thus recursive calls don't work as expected. metamonad
provides a recursive version of +let+, +letrec+, which works the same way as
+let+, except that it does the binding recursively. The above example can be
implemented correctly using +letrec+:

--------------------------------------
letrec<
  fact,
  lambda<
    n,
    boost::mpl::eval_if<
      boost::mpl::equal_to<n, boost::mpl::int_<0> >,
      boost::mpl::int_<1>,
      boost::mpl::times<
        boost::mpl::apply<
          fact,
          boost::mpl::minus<n, boost::mpl::int_<1> >
        >,
        n
      >
    >
  >,
  boost::mpl::apply<fact, boost::mpl::int_<3> >
>
--------------------------------------

Haskell typeclasses in template metaprograms
--------------------------------------------

We need to introduce an equivalent of the Haskell typeclass in template
metaprogramming. It can be implemented using traits:

* The typeclass is a trait, the template argument is a +tag+
* Instances of the typeclass are specialisations of the trait
* Functions required by the typeclass are implemented as template metafunction
  classes in the specialisations
* For a typeclass X, a template class called X_defaults implements the functions
  with default implementations. Every instance of the typeclass is expected to
  publicly inherit from this template class with the same template argument.
* The specialisation of the trait inheriting from the +_defaults+ class can
  override any of the default implementations.

There is no way of expressing which functions instances of the typeclass have
to implement. This solution makes the usage of typeclasses explicit in the code.

Example:
~~~~~~~~

Typeclass in Haskell:

--------------------------------------
class Monad m where
  bind :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  bind_ :: m a -> m b -> m b
  return :: a -> m a

  bind m k = bind m (\_ -> k)
--------------------------------------

Its template metaprogramming equivalent:

--------------------------------------
using boost::mpl;

template <class Tag>
struct monad;
// Requires:
//   struct return_ { template <class> struct apply; };
//   struct bind { template <class> struct apply; };

template <class Tag>
struct monad_defaults
{
  template <class A, class B>
  struct apply : apply_wrap2<typename monad<Tag>::bind, A, always<B> > {};
};
--------------------------------------

An instance of this class in Haskell:

--------------------------------------
instance Monad M where
  return a = ...
  bind (M a) f = ...
--------------------------------------

An instance of this class in template metaprogramming:

--------------------------------------
struct m_tag;

template <>
struct monad<m_tag> : monad_defaults<m_tag>
{
  struct return
  {
    template <class T>
    struct apply { ... };
  };

  struct bind
  {
    template <class T, class F>
    struct apply { ... };
  };
};
--------------------------------------

Reporting errors
----------------

Error reporting is presented using a simple template metafunction as an example.
This metafunction takes two arguments and returns the smaller one. It will be
called +min+, and will be implemented by another metafunction, +less+, that
takes two arguments and returns +true+ or +false+ depending on whether the first
argument is smaller than the second one. +min+ will use +less+ to decide which
one of its arguments is smaller. The metafunctions +min+ and +less+ will be
polymorphic: they will work with any compile-time data that can be compared.
When someone develops a new compile-time data type in the future, he should be
able to extend these metafunctions to work with his type, as well, without
changing existing code.

First +less+ needs to be implemented, which is a metafunction taking 2
arguments: the values to compare. Following boost::mpl's approach to make it
polymorphic, it can be defined the following way:

--------------------------------------
template <class Tag1, class Tag2>
struct less_impl;

template <class A, class B>
struct less :
  boost::mpl::apply<
    less_impl<
      typename boost::mpl::tag<A>::type,
      typename boost::mpl::tag<B>::type
    >,
    A,
    B
  >
{};
--------------------------------------

For +less+ to support the different compile-time data structures, a
specialization of +less_impl+ needs to be implemented per data type.

When a developer uses +less+ with a data type it doesn't support (for example
because those types of values can not be compared) this implementation breaks
the compilation process. Using metamonad, +less+ can be implemented in a way,
that it returns a special value representing error in these cases. metamonad
provides the +exception+ compile-time data structure. The +exception+ template
takes one argument, an arbitrary compile-time data value that is meant to
describe the error. The general case of +less+ can be implemented the following
way:

--------------------------------------
struct not_comparable;

template <class T1, class T2>
struct less_impl
{
  template <class A, class B>
  struct apply
  {
    typedef exception<not_comparable> type;
  };
};
--------------------------------------

The helper class, +not_comparable+, represents the error message.

+min+ can be implemented in terms of +less+.
+min+ takes two arguments, compares them using +less+ and returns the
smaller one. It can be implemented the following way:

--------------------------------------
template <class A, class B>
struct min : boost::mpl::if_<less<A, B>, A, B> {};
--------------------------------------

When the arguments are comparable, it works fine. However, when the two
arguments can not be compared, +less+ returns an +exception+, not a wrapped
boolean value, which breaks +if_+. Thus, the result of +less+ has to be checked.
When this is an error, it has to be returned as it is, otherwise it can be used
to calculate the result of +min+.

Using monads
------------

The previous section shows how to return error values from template
metafunctions and that they needs to be propagated up to a point, when they can
be handled. Implementing this error propagation manually is a tedious and
error-prone process, not to mention how less readable the code becomes.
For imperative languages exceptions were invented to work around this. C\++
template metaprogramming is a pure functional language, metafunctions can not
have side-effects. Throwing an exception would be a side-effect, thus it is not 
possible. Haskell uses monads to handle side-effects in pure functions. Monads,
among many other things, can be used for error handling and propagation in pure
code. metamonad follows Haskell's approach to implement monads in C++ template
metaprogramming.

metamonad provides a monad for error propagation. It is similar to Haskell's
+Either+. Every value in template metaprogramming belongs to this monad, thus
values don't need wrapping and functions don't need lifting to work in this
monad. The values with +exception_tag+ are treated as special values -- they
represent errors and are propagated. The error propagation monad is identified
by +exception_tag+. Note that values representing errors and the monad itself
are both identified by the same +tag+. Given that they are used in different
contexts, it doesn't cause confusion.

The following two metafunction classes will be used as examples to show how
monads work:

--------------------------------------
struct may_fail1
{
  template <class T>
  struct apply
     // ...
  {};
};

struct may_fail2
{
  template <class T>
  struct apply
    // ...
  {};
};
--------------------------------------

They do some calculation that either succeeds or fails and they expect that no
errors (+exception+ values) will be passed to them as arguments.
Assume that +may_fail1+ needs to be called and its result needs to be passed to
+may_fail2+:

--------------------------------------
boost::mpl::apply<
  may_fail2,
  boost::mpl::apply<may_fail1, boost::mpl::int_<13> >::type
>
--------------------------------------

In this case, when +may_fail1+ returns an error, this error gets passed to
+may_fail2+, which should not happen. To avoid it, the return value of
+may_fail1+ needs to be verified first and +may_fail2+ has to be or must not be
called based on it. The error monad implements this logic, thus the above
example can be implemented safely the following way:

--------------------------------------
bind<exception_tag,
  bind<exception_tag, retrun_<boost::mpl::int_<13> >, may_fail1>,
  may_fail2
>
--------------------------------------

+bind+ checks the result of the previous step, which is the second argument of
the +bind+ metafunction. When it is an error, +bind+ returns this error.
Otherwise +bind+ passes this value to the continuation, which the third argument
of +bind+, a metafunction class taking one argument. Using the error monad
guarantees, that +may_fail2+ is never called with an error value. Using this
monad, the functions that are chained don't have to deal with error propagation.

When more than two functions need to be chained together, or the flow of data
is not as simple as passing the result of one step to the next one, expressions
using +bind+ directly become extremely complicated. Haskell provides a syntactic
sugar for these situations, which is called the __do notation__. metamonad
provides a template metaprogramming tool, similar to Haskell's do notation.
Using it, the above example can be written the following way:

--------------------------------------
struct r;

MPLLIBS_DO<exception_tag>::apply<
  MPLLIBS_SET<r, may_fail1<MPLLIBS_RETURN<boost::mpl::int_<13> > >,
  may_fail2<r>
>
--------------------------------------

This implementation uses +MPLLIBS_SET+ to bind the result of calling the
+may_fail1+ metafunction to a name, +r+. Instead of using +return_+ directly,
it uses +MPLLIBS_RETURN+, which evaluates +return_+ with the monad +tag+ used
by the do block, in this case +exception_tag+. The result of +may_fail1+ can be
passed to +may_fail2+ using the name +r+.

The next two sections present monads and the do notation in detail.

Monads
------

A monad consists of the following:

* A +tag+, identifying the monad itself
* A set of metaprogramming values (which are types)
* Two basic operations:
** +return_<class>+ taking some value and returning an element of the set
** +bind<class, class>+ taking an element of the set and a function, taking
   some value and returning an element of the set. +bind+ returns an element of
   the set.
* Two further operations:
** +bind_+ taking two monadic values and returning a new monadic value. It has a
   default implementation that calls +bind+ with the first value and a
   metafunction class that always returns the second argument of +bind_+.
** +fail+ taking a value and returning a monadic value that breaks the
   execution of the monad. It has a default implementation that throws a
   compile-time exception.

In Haskell the set of values is identified by the type system, in template
metaprogramming it is identified by an informal description in the
documentation.

Similarly to Haskell, metamonad provides the link:monad.html[monad] typeclass
for implementing monads. It requires +return_+ and +bind+ to be implemented as
metafunction classes.

metamonad uses +tags+ to identify monads themselves, but not to identify the set
of values. +tags+ are used as a replacement of Haskell's value constructors and
pattern matching. For example Haskell's +Maybe+ is implemented the following
way to support metafunction overloading:

--------------------------------------
struct nothing_tag;
struct just_tag;

struct nothing { typedef nothing_tag tag; };

template <class T>
struct just { typedef just_tag tag; };
--------------------------------------

The +Maybe+ monad consists of the +nothing+ and +just+ values, which have
different +tags+. Because of this, +tags+ cannot be used to identify the set of
values belonging to a monad.

metamonad provides metafunctions for the operations implemented by the
typeclass to hide the typeclass itself behind monads. These functions take the
+tag+ of the monad as their first argument and call the same operation of the
typeclass:

--------------------------------------
template <class MonadTag, class SomeValue>
struct return_;

template <
  class MonadTag,
  class SomeValue,
  class FunctionReturningElementOfSet
>
struct bind;
--------------------------------------

Haskell has semantic expectations for monads that are
documented but can not be verified by the compiler. The C++ template
metaprogramming equivalent of these expectations are the following.

* left identity:
    +monad<Tag>::bind<monad<Tag>::return_<X>, F>+ is equivalent to
    +boost::mpl::apply<F, X>+.
* right identity:
    +monad<Tag>::bind<M, monad<Tag>::return_>+ is equivalent to +M+.
* associativity:
    +monad<Tag>::bind<M, lambda<x, monad<Tag>::bind<boost::mpl::apply<F, x>, G> > >+
    is equivalent to +monad<Tag>::bind<monad<Tag>::bind<M, F>, G>+. +lambda+ is
    metamonad's lambda expression implementation.

Similarly to Haskell, metamonad cannot verify these expectations. It is the
responsibility of the monad's author to satisfy these expectations.

do notation
-----------

Haskell provides syntactic sugar for monads, called __do notation__. In Haskell,
a __do block__ is associated with a monad and contains a number of monadic
function calls and value bindings. Here is an example do block:

--------------------------------------
do
  r <- may_fail1 13
  may_fail2 r
--------------------------------------

This evaluates +may_fail1 13+, binds +r+ to its result and evaluates
+may_fail2 r+. metamonad implements a similar notation for writing monadic
template metaprograms. A do block using metamonad looks like the following:

--------------------------------------
MPLLIBS_DO<monad_tag>::apply<
  step1,
  step2,

  // ...

  stepn
>
--------------------------------------

+MPLLIBS_DO+ is a macro which expands to the name of a template class.
+monad_tag+ is the +tag+ identifying the monad. This has to be passed to the
+return_+ and +bind+ functions. +MPLLIBS_DO<monad_tag>+ is a metafunction class,
taking the steps of the do block as arguments. A step is either a nullary
metafunction returning a monadic value, or a binding of an expression to a name.
A binding is expressed by the following structure:

--------------------------------------
MPLLIBS_SET<name, step>
--------------------------------------

where +MPLLIBS_SET+ is a macro, expanding to the name of a template class.
+step+ is a nullary metafunction returning a monadic value. +name+ is the name
of a class, the binding binds the result of +step+ to this name. The bound name
can be used in the steps of the do block following the binding.

Using +return_+ in do blocks directly is not convenient, since the +tag+ of the
monad has to be passed to the +return_+ metafunction explicitly, thus every time
+return_+ is used, the +tag+ of the monad needs to be repeated. For example:

--------------------------------------
MPLLIBS_DO<monad_tag>::apply<
  step1,
  step2,
  MPLLIBS_SET<some_name, return_<monad_tag, some_value> >,

  // ...

  stepn
>
--------------------------------------

To make using +return_+ in do blocks simpler, metamonad provides a macro,
+MPLLIBS_RETURN+, that can be used in do blocks:

--------------------------------------
MPLLIBS_DO<monad_tag>::apply<
  step1,
  step2,
  MPLLIBS_SET<some_name, MPLLIBS_RETURN<some_value> >,

  // ...

  stepn
>
--------------------------------------

Compile-time exceptions
-----------------------

The way the +exception+ monad propagates errors is similar to how exceptions are
propagated in runtime C++ code. Based on this similarity, metamonad provides
tools for handling exceptions in template metaprograms. These tools are based on
monads and the do notation.

Exceptions handling happens by using a __try block__, which looks like the
following:

--------------------------------------
MPLLIBS_DO_TRY<
  step1,
  step2,
  
  // ...
  
  stepn
>
--------------------------------------

A try block is a special +MPLLIBS_DO<exception_tag>+ block, thus the body of it
can be constructed the same way as the body of a do block. The main difference
between a regular do block and a try block is how the result of it can be
handled. Try blocks can be followed by exception handling blocks, dealing with
error values returned by the body of the try block. These exception handling
blocks are called __catch blocks__, since they are similar to the catch blocks
of runtime C++ code. Here is an example try block with two catch blocks:

--------------------------------------
struct e;

struct non_comparable_tag;

template <class WrappedException>
struct arguments_can_not_be_compared;

struct unknown_error;

template <class A, class B>
struct min :
  MPLLIBS_DO_TRY<
    MPLLIBS_SET<c, less<A, B> >,
    boost::mpl::if_<c, A, B>
  >
  ::template catch_<non_comparable_tag, e>
    ::template apply<
      THROW<arguments_can_not_be_compared<e> >
    >
  ::template catch_<catch_any, e>
    ::template apply<MPLLIBS_THROW<unknown_error> >
{};
--------------------------------------

Error values returned by the try block are differentiated by the +tag+ of the
error message (which is, for example the template argument of the +exception+
template). A catch block is an application of the template metafunction class
+catch_<class Tag, class Name>+. +Tag+ specifies, which +tags+ this catch block
handles, +Name+ is a class that is used as a placeholder for the actual error
value in the body of the catch block. The metafunction class takes a
nullary metafunction as argument, which is the body of the catch block. When
the catch block is evaluated, this body gets evaluated.

When the body of a try block returns an error, at most one of the
catch blocks is evaluated. The blocks are checked in order, each one specifies
the +tag+ it handles. The first one specifying the +tag+ of the error message
or specifying +catch_any+ as +tag+ is selected. +catch_any+ catches all
exceptions, it is similar to +...+ in C++ exceptions.

When a catch block was chosen, the result of the catch block is the result of
the whole try-catch structure. When no catch block was chosen or the try block
returned no error, the result of the try block is the result of the whole
structure.

To narrow the gap between the syntax of C++ and compile-time exceptions, a
metafunction +MPLLIBS_THROW+ is provided for constructing error values. It takes
one argument, which is the error message.

Advanced compile-time exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have seen so far how to handle exceptions using do-blocks, but we can handle
exceptions in regular template metaprogramming code as well -- we don't need to
know about monads and do-blocks. metamonad provides
link:MPLLIBS_TRY.html[MPLLIBS_TRY] blocks, which work the same way as
link:MPLLIBS_DO_TRY.html[MPLLIBS_DO_TRY] blocks except that the body of the
+TRY+ block is a nullary metafunction instead of a do-block. When a
sub-expression of the +TRY+ block evaluates to an exception the evaluation of
the entire nullary metafunction stops and the result of the +TRY+ block is the
exception. It may be handled by the +catch_+ blocks or it is the result of the
try-catch block.

Here is an example of this:
--------------------------------------
using boost::mpl;

struct e;

template <class T>
struct always_throw : MPLLIBS_THROW<int_<13> > {};

typedef
  MPLLIBS_TRY<
    plus<int_<1>, always_throw<int_<2> > >
  >
  ::catch_<catch_any, e>
    ::apply<e>
  ::type
  this_is_13;
--------------------------------------

In this example one of the arguments of +plus+ throws a compile-time exception.
Since +plus+ is used in an +MPLLIBS_TRY+ block, +plus+ itself is never called
with an exception as its argument. +MPLLIBS_TRY+ delegates the exception to the
+catch_+ block which handels it.
