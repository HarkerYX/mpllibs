mpllibs::metamonad
==================
Abel Sinkovics

The main purpose of this library is implementing monads and exception handling
for C++ template metaprograms. Apart from that it contains tools implementing
let expressions and lambda expressions for template metaprograms.
The library contains the following components:

* Let expressions
* Lambda expressions
* Haskell typeclasses in template metaprograms
* Monads for template metaprograms
* The do notation
* Compile-time exceptions

The library provides metafunctions for the monadic operations, that can be
overridden.
The library implements an embedded domain specific language based on
Haskell's do notation for monads. Template metaprograms using it are easier to
read and to maintain. Even though the library was built based on Haskell,
developers can use it without knowing the Haskell language.

The library implements an error handling mechanism for template metaprograms
that is similar to exception handling in runtime code. The library calls this
technique compile-time exception handling, and it is based on monads.
