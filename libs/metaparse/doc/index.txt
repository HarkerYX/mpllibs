mpllibs::metaparse
==================
Abel Sinkovics

Metaparse is parser generator library for template metaprograms. The purpose of this
library is to support the creation of parsers that parse at compile time. This
library is inteded to be used for embedded domain specific language creation
for C\++. The input of the generated parser is a compile time string, see
+boost::mpl::string+. The result of the parsing process is either an error or
any other result the writer of the parser specifies.
The library is based on the paper of
http://www.cs.lth.se/eda120/assignment4/parser.pdf[L. Andersson].
