Introduction
------------

Welcome to the website of _mpllibs_. This is a collection of C++ template
metaprogramming libraries.

Components
----------

_mpllibs_ contains the following libraries:

* link:libs/metatest/html/index.html[metatest] -
    Unit testing framework for C++ template metaprograms
* link:libs/metamonad/html/index.html[metamonad] -
    Library implementing monads and exceptions in C++ template metaprograms
* link:libs/metaparse/html/index.html[metaparse] -
    A library for generating compile time parsers parsing embedded
    DSL code as part of the C++ compilation process
* link:libs/safe_printf/html/index.html[safe_printf] -
    A type-safe +printf+, +fprintf+ and +sprintf+ implementation

Building the library on Linux:
------------------------------

* +mkdir bin && cd bin && cmake ..+ sets the build directory up
* +make+ builds the code
* +make test+ runs the unit tests
* +make website+ generates the documentation

Building the library on Windows:
--------------------------------

* Start the CMake gui.
* Set _Where is the source code_ to the root directory of the mpllibs source
  code.
* Set _Where to build the binaries_ to the directory where you would like to
  build the binaries to. It may be the "bin" directory of the mpllibs source
  code.
* Click on _Configure_ and choose the compiler to use.
* Click on _Generate_ to generate the solution file.
* Open the generated solution in your development environment and build it.
* When you run the unit tests and the examples on Windows, make sure you have
  +metatest.dll+ on your +PATH+.
