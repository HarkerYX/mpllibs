mpllibs is a collection of C++ template metaprogramming libraries, most of
which are header-only.



It extends the Boost MPL library:
http://boost.org/libs/mpl


Building the library on Linux:

  mkdir bin
  cd bin
  cmake ..
  make

The libraries have self-testing code, which can be executed by running:

  make test

Documentation can be generated by running:

  make website

Building the library on Windows:

  Start the CMake gui.
  Set "Where is the source code" to the root directory of the mpllibs source
    code.
  Set "Where to build the binaries" to the directory where you would like to
    build the binaries to. It may be the "bin" directory of the mpllibs source
    code.
  Click on "Configure" and choose the compiler to use.
  Click on "Generate" to generate the solution file.
  Open the generated solution in your development environment and build it.

Running the tests on Windows:
  
  Make sure you have "metatest.dll" on your PATH when you run the test
    executables.
