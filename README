mpllibs is a collection of C++ template metaprogramming libraries, all of
which are header-only.



It extends the Boost MPL library:

The libraries have self-testing code, which can be executed by running

  make check

in the src directory.


Documentation can be generated by running

  make html

in the src directory.
